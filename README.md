Page Replacement Visualizer Algorithm in HTML
This is a simple webpage that visualizes the page replacement algorithms used in operating systems. This project can be used to help students understand how page replacement algorithms work and how they can be implemented.

Installation
1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jay1820/page-replacement-visualizer.git
2.Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Usage
The page replacement algorithms that are currently implemented in this project are:
•	First In First Out (FIFO)


To use the visualization tool, follow these steps:
•	Select a page replacement algorithm from the dropdown menu.
•	Enter the number of frames that you want to use for the simulation.
•	Enter a reference string, which is a string of numbers that represent the pages that are being accessed.
•	Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
•	The simulation will run and display the results on the screen. You can step through the simulation using the "Next" button.
